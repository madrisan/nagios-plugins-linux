  * Initial Debian release:
    - check_multipath: recent versions of multipath no longer open a multipathd

      Thanks to Chris Procter "chr15p" for reporting the issue and creating a
      pull request.
    - check_multipath: use a larger buffer for queries to make this plugin
      working with systems that have lots of mapped disks.
    - A framework for testing the code (make check) has been added and some
      tests are now available.

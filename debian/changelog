nagios-plugins-linux (19-1) stable; urgency=low

  * Initial Debian release:
    - check_multipath: recent versions of multipath no longer open a multipathd
      socket file in the file system, but instead use an abstract namespace
      socket (@/org/kernel/linux/storage/multipathd).
      Thanks to Chris Procter "chr15p" for reporting the issue and creating a
      pull request.
    - check_multipath: use a larger buffer for queries to make this plugin
      working with systems that have lots of mapped disks.
    - A framework for testing the code (make check) has been added and some
      tests are now available.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 22 and 23
                   -= Korbielow.pl 2018 release =-

-- Enhancements

* New plugin 'check_docker':

  This new plugin can be used for:
   * checking the total number of running docker containers or the containers
     of a given type
   * checking the memory usage (alpha!)

* Build system:

   * Build the sources with the available compiler's hardening flags.
     The following compiler flags are tested/added when available:
      * -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 (Buffer overflow checks)
      * -fstack-protector-strong or -fstack-protector-all
      * -fpie -fPIE (Position Independent Executable support)
      * -Wstack-protector
      * -Wl,-z,relro (RELRO (read-only relocation))
      * -Wl,-z,now

     The option `--disable-hardening' disable the attempt to harden
     the resulting executables.

   * End the ./configure output with a summary of the build options.

   * Add the option --enable-werror to ./configure, to make all warnings
     as errors. This option is disabled by default.

* Package creation:

   * Add Fedora 27 and Fedora 28 to the supported distributions.

* Test framework:

   * Some new unit tests have been added.
      * lib/container
      * lib/url_encode
      * tests/testutils

-- Fixes:

* Fix some issues reported by Codacy, Coverity, and LGTM.

-- Experimental

* Add the command line option `--enable-libprocps' that will
  link the binaries with the library libprocps newlib instead
  of using the internal libraries.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 21 and 22
    -- "Commit 600" release

-- Fixes

* vminfo lib: add the following items to the /proc/vmstat parser:
   - vm_pgalloc_dma32
   - vm_pgrefill_dma32
   - vm_pgscan_direct_dma32
   - vm_pgscan_kswapd_dma32
   - vm_pgsteal_dma32
   - vm_pgsteal_direct_dma
   - vm_pgsteal_direct_dma32

  The DMA32 memory zone is only available on 64-bit linux
  (low ~4GBytes of memory).  This patch can slightly modify the value
  of the memory counters reported by check_memory.

-- Enhancements

* Fix several warnings reported by Codacy and Codeclimate.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 20 and 21

-- Enhancements

* check_paging: the command-line option `--swapping-only' has been
  added for displaying only the swap reads and writes. The help
  message has been updated and improved by added some lines that
  explain which kernel variable(s) are selected when a user specify
  the warning and/or critical thresholds.

* The Docker-based framework for packaging the Nagios Plugins for
  Linux (test-build) supports two new extra distributions:

    Debian 9 (Stretch)
    Fedora 26

* The test framework (make check) has been reworked and enriched in
  new modules:

    tests/tsclock_thresholds
    tests/tscswch
    tests/tsintr
    tests/tslibmeminfo_conversions
    tests/tslibmeminfo_interface
    tests/tslibmeminfo_procparser
    tests/tslibmessages
    tests/tslibvminfo
    tests/tsload_normalize
    tests/tsload_thresholds
    tests/tspaging
    tests/tstemperature
    tests/tsuptime

  The result of each text execution is now diplayed with colors.

* The code of several plugins has been polished and modularized to
  allow testing.

* The glibc function `secure_getenv()' (or `__secure_getenv()' on
  Ubuntu, and maybe other distributions) is now used, instead of
  `getenv()', in the test code to improve security.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 19 and 20

-- Security fixes

* Some insecure data handling issues discovered by Coverity in the
  new test framework have been fixed.

-- Enhancements

* The Clang Static Analyser can now be executed by running the command
    make -C tests check-clang-checker
  in the project root directory.
  All the warnings spotted by this code analyser have been fixed.

* A new Docker-based framework for packaging the Nagios Plugins for
  Linux (rpm and deb packages) is now available.
  The supported Linux distributions follow:

   CentOS 5/6/7
   Debian 6 (Squeeze), 7 (Wheezy), 8 (Jessie)
   Fedora 24/25/rawhide
   RHEL 5/6/7

* Nagios Plugins for Linux has been Debianized.

* The messages displayed in case of a too large "count" or "delay"
  error have been improved.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 18 and 19

-- Fixes

* check_multipath: recent versions of multipath no longer open a
  multipathd socket file in the file system, but instead use an
  abstract namespace socket: @/org/kernel/linux/storage/multipathd.
  Thanks to Chris Procter "chr15p" for reporting the issue and
  creating a pull request.

* check_load: fixed the performance data output

-- Security fixes

  check_cpu: fixed coverity 152987 "Untrusted loop bound"
  check_cswch: fixed coverity 152985 "Untrusted loop bound"
  check_fc: fixed coverity 152984 "Untrusted value as argument"
  check_intr: fixed coverity 152986 "Untrusted loop bound"

-- Enhancements

* check_multipath: fixed the long-standing gcc compiler warning:
    "dereferencing type-punned pointer might break strict-aliasing
     rules [-Wstrict-aliasing]".
  This was a false problem, but the code has been modified to quiet
  the warning.

* check_multipath: use a larger buffer for queries to make this
  plugin working with systems that have lots of mapped disks.

* test-suite: a framework for testing the code (make check) has been
  added and some tests are now available.

-- Compatibility issues

* check_multipath: by default the abstract namespace socket
  "@/org/kernel/linux/storage/multipathd" is now selected at build
  time.  If you need to monitor old distributions (RHEL5 and RHEL6
  for instance) you need to configure this package as followed:

    ./configure --with-socketfile=/var/run/multipathd.sock

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 17 and 18

-- Fixes

* check_clock,
  check_cpufreq,
  check_cswch,
  check_intr,
  check_multipath,
  check_nbprocs,
  check_network,
  check_tcpcount,
  check_users: fix the return code of the warning and critical
  case.  Thanks Paul Dunkler for pointing out this issue.

* check_cpu: fix the detection of the CPU 64-bit op-mode.

* check_cpu: fix a memory resource leak reported by the Coverity Scan
  tool.

* meminfo lib (check_memory): use SReclaimable in cached.
  The cached memory is something you can get back and reclaim if
  under memory pressure.  Make cached only use the reclaimable
  component and ignore the unreclaimable values which doesn't make
  sense in this context.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 16 and 17
    -- "400th (git) commit" release

-- Enhancements

* check_fc: new plugin for checking the status of the fiber channel
  ports.

-- Fixes

* Fix a resource leak in the library 'thresholds'.

* Minor fix in the library 'interrupt'.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 15 and 16
    -- "25 aprile" release

-- Enhancements

* check_cpufreq: new plugin.

* meminfo lib: reduce the memory footprint by not allocating the
  variable exported by /proc/memory and not used by any plugin.

* check_cpu: new option '--per-cpu' for checking the CPU utilization
  for each CPU.  A warning message is returned if at least one CPU
  exceeds the warning threshold and no CPU exceed the critical state.
  A critical message is returned if at least one CPU exceeds the
  critical threshold.
  The option '--cpufreq' has been removed because this information is
  now provided by the new plugin 'check_cpufreq'.

-- Fixes

* check_multipath: fix the regular expression that catches the failed
  paths and that prevented the plugin from working correctly.

* Improved code quality based on the Coverity scan analysis.

* Build system: minor fixes to make the Travis-CI Continuous
  Integration work - gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5) environment.
  Update some obsolete macros used by configure.ac.
  Portability has been improved.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 14 and 15

-- Enhancements

* check_memory / meminfo lib: the command line option '-C|--caches'
  now does nothing but is still accepted for compatibility.
  The memory usage calculation has been reviewed and is now more
  accurate.  The changes are based on the (long) discussions and
  patches that have been recently posted in the procps mailing list.

* check_memory / meminfo lib: a fall-back has been implemented in
  order to provide the memory available counter for the linux kernels
  2.6.27 and above,

* check_cpu: add one decimal digit to the counters 'cpu_user',
  'cpu_system', 'cpu_idle', 'cpu_iowait', and 'cpu_steal'.

* check_cpu: new command line option '-m|--no-cpu-model' for removing
  the cpu model description from the output message.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 13 and 14
                     -= Korbielow 2014 release =-

-- Enhancements

* check_users: new '--verbose' mode, for debugging.

* check_uptime: new option '-m|--clock-monotonic' for retrieving the
  time of the linux monotonic clock instead of using the system 
  statistics returned by 'sysinfo()'.

* New library 'xstrtol' containing the function 'strtol_or_err' that
  was previosly duplicated in several plugins.

-- Fixes

* check_clock: option '--refclock': validate the input instead of
  returning crap when the date format is unsupported.

* check_readonlys: do not dereference a null pointer string in the
  output message when no readonly filesystems are detected.

* Minor fixes.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 12 and 13

-- Enhancements

* The build system, the plugins and libraries are been reworked in
  order to support some older Linux kernels and (gcc) compilers.
  The "nagios-plugins-linux" can now be compiled and run on older
  linux systems, like RHEL 5 (gcc 4.1.2, kernel 2.6.18).

* check_memory: new option '-a|--available' for selecting the kernel
  counter 'MemAvailable' instead of the default one (memory used).
  This feature requires a Linux kernel 3.14 or better.
  For older kernels the plugin falls back to the free memory counter.

-- Fixes

* check_tcpcount: do not exit with 'error opening /proc/net/tcp6'
  when the command line option '--tcp6' has not been specified.

* cpustats library: do not exit with an error message if 'softirq'
  cannot be found in /proc/stat'. This entry is not provided by old
  kernels.

=====================================================================
    
    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 11 and 12

* New plugin 'check_intr'.
* meminfo library: get 'MemAvailable' value from /proc/meminfo
  (kernel 3.14+) for a future usage.
* check_cswch: fix the unit displayed in the output message when
  'count' is 1.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 10 and 11

* New plugin 'check_cswch'.
* check_cpu: better output of '--cpuinfo' when a hot pluggable cpu
  is offline.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 9 and 10

* check_temperature: modify the syntax of the switch command

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 7 and 8

* New plugin 'check_network'.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 6 and 7

* Minor fixes.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 5 and 6

* The plugun 'check_load' now always display the three loads (1, 5,
  and 15 minuts load) in the perfdata.
* Plugins 'check_memory', 'check_swap': new argument '--vmstats'.
* Plugin 'check_memory': properly handle memory used by tmpfs.
* Reports the paging activity per second instead of the value since
  last boot in 'check_memory', and 'check_swap'.
* The internal libraries have been completely reworked.
* Build system: rework the build system and enable the silent mode.
